# Read project context

Before responding to each prompt, read `.cursor/prompts/project-context.md`.

- Use it as primary context for the project (design, status, next steps).
- If it references other files (e.g. `project-overview.md`, `project-plan.md`, `project-status.md`), read those too and apply their contents.
- If the file is empty or missing, proceed as usual.
