# User preferences

How I like to work with Cursor agents. Edit this file to add your own; the agent will apply these to every response.

---

## Communication

- _Example: Prefer concise replies unless I ask for detail._
- _Example: Explain non-obvious changes in 1–2 sentences._

---

## Workflow

- Do not make any code or project changes without first discussing the approach and receiving my approval, unless I explicitly ask you to implement something in my prompt.
- _Example: Suggest a plan before making large edits._
- _Example: Prefer multiple small edits over one big change._
- **After each code change**: Check and update project-status.md, README.md, and project-plan.md so they reflect the current state.

---

## Code / project

- _Example: Use Swift naming from the Apple style guide._
- _Example: Prefer fixing in place over refactoring unless I ask._

---

_Add or remove sections as you like. The agent reads this file at the start of each turn._
